# Etch-A-Sketch
This project is an interactive web application that combines sketchbook and an Etch-a-Sketch, using modern technologies such a HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The goal of the application is to provide a creative and fun tool that allows users to draw freely, and to flex the DOM manipulation skills of mine.

The app is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, offering options to change the sizes of grid cells and other drawing settings.
